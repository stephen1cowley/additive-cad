        "context": "Conscription in the United States , commonly known as the draft , has been employed by the federal government of the United States in five conflicts : the American Revolution , the American Civil War , World War I , World War II , and the Cold War ( including both the Korean War and the Vietnam War ) . The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act . It was the country 's first peacetime draft . From 1940 until 1973 , during both peacetime and periods of conflict , men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means . The draft came to an end when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all - volunteer military force . However , the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan ; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed . United States Federal Law also provides for the compulsory conscription of men between the ages of 17 and 45 and certain women for militia service pursuant to Article I , Section 8 of the United States Constitution and 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 246 .",

        "context": "<Ul> <Li> Tim Allen as Mike Baxter : Mike is a father of three daughters and the director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores . He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . </Li> <Li> Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end . </Li> <Li> Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . </Li> <Li> Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home .",

Later it endured invasion attempts from the French , Dutch , and British . Four centuries of Spanish colonial government influenced the island 's cultural landscapes with waves of African slaves , Canarian , and Andalusian settlers . In the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary , but strategic role when compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and the mainland parts of New Spain . Spain 's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century , helping to produce a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined elements from the Native Americans , Africans , and Iberians . In 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris . The treaty took effect on April 11 , 1899 .",

        "context": "<Ul> <Li> Tim Allen as Mike Baxter : Mike is a father of three daughters and the director of marketing for the Outdoor Man chain of sporting goods stores . He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . </Li> <Li> Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end . </Li> <Li> Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . </Li> <Li> Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home .",

This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles . Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to \u00a3 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint . Under this act , the Chancellor of the Exchequer took over the role , with a Deputy Master being appointed by the Treasury to exercise all the powers and duties of the Master within the mint .",

The law includes a qui tam provision that allows people who are not affiliated with the government , called `` relators '' under the law , to file actions on behalf of the government ( informally called `` whistleblowing '' especially when the relator is employed by the organization accused in the suit ) . Persons filing under the Act stand to receive a portion ( usually about 15 -- 25 percent ) of any recovered damages . As of 2012 , over 70 percent of all federal Government FCA actions were initiated by whistleblowers . Claims under the law have typically involved health care , military , or other government spending programs , and dominate the list of largest pharmaceutical settlements . The government recovered $38.9 billion under the False Claims Act between 1987 and 2013 and of this amount , $27.2 billion or 70 % was from qui tam cases brought by relators .",

After reading a newspaper story about a beauty queen who died of a drug overdose , Bill views the body at the morgue and identifies it as Mandy . Bill is summoned to Ziegler 's house , where he is confronted with the events of the past night and day . Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy , and identified Bill and his connection with Nick . Ziegler claims that he had Bill followed for his own protection , and that the warnings made against Bill by the society are only intended to scare him from speaking about the orgy . However , he implies the society is capable of acting on their threats . Bill asks about the death of Mandy , whom Ziegler has identified as the masked woman at the party who 'd `` sacrificed '' herself to prevent Bill 's punishment , and about the disappearance of Nick , the piano player . Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at his home in Seattle . Ziegler also says the `` punishment '' was a charade by the secret society to further frighten Bill , and it had nothing to do with Mandy 's death ; she was a hooker and addict and had died from another accidental drug overdose . Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth about Nick 's disappearance or Mandy 's death , but he says nothing further . When he returns home , Bill finds the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife . He breaks down in tears and decides to tell Alice the whole truth of the past two days . The next morning , they go Christmas shopping with their daughter . Alice muses that they should be grateful that they have survived , that she loves him and there is something they must do as soon as possible .

        "context": "The film is set in Los Angeles in the then - future of 1996 . Harley Davidson ( Mickey Rourke ) , dressed in biker gear , with ultra-short dyed hair , hears from the radio about a dangerous new street drug named `` Crystal Dream '' . ( The significance of this street drug does not become clear until later . ) Harley goes into a rough bar and sees a cowboy - looking fellow ( Don Johnson wearing a beard , cowboy hat and boots ) . He has scammed a fellow in a pool game but has to use strong measures when the fellow refuses payment . Harley helps him in this . We learn that they are old friends ( later we learn the name he goes by is The Marlboro Man . ) They visit a blues ( old jazz ? ) bar in Burbank , which they both hold special . They go into a back room and meet Jack Daniels , an extremely - heavily - muscled lad , who immediately goes to fight Harley due to an old feud over a woman . After a manly exchange of blows and body slams , Harley tells him that he knows that the woman loves Jack and they make friends . Soon it is revealed that the bar is about to be demolished as the lease will not be renewed . `` Suits '' at Great Trust bank plan to replace it with a skyscraper . Harley , Marlboro , Jack and two friends decide to rob a bank to raise the money to ensure the bar 's survival . A comely waitress hooks up with Harley . Marlboro borrows Harley 's Harley and baits a motorcycle cop , with interesting results . In a bit of psychological revelation , we learn that he is in an intermittent amorous relationship with a beautiful woman , who tells him that she is going to settle down with another man , as she is not getting enough loving from him . He is conflicted by the news but later tells Harley that he is not the kind of man who has a wife . Harley arrives and takes her out for breakfast . An armored car is going down a street and meets a detour sign . Marlboro jumps on its back door and climbs to its roof ( a visual parallel of train robbers crawling on the roofs of boxcars in old western movies ) . The contents of the armored car is heisted in a well - thought - out scheme , but the escape of Harley / Marlboro 's gang is almost foiled by the appearance of a squad of black - trenchcoat - wearing ( a la Matrix ) machinepistol - firing soldiers . Jack drives a fiery motorcycle into the fray and allows them to escape . But they discover the goods they have stolen are a large amount of `` Crystal Dream '' , not money . Chance Wilder ( Tom Sizemore ) , president of the Great Trust branch , is obviously involved in drug dealing . Harley and Marlboro go to the bank . Showing considerable balls , Harley negotiates an exchange - the drugs for $2.5 M. The exchange goes down smoothly in a visually - fascinating airplane graveyard , but then the bank 's squad of soldiers finds them celebrating at the bar and it is not pretty , although Harley and Marlboro manage to escape with the money . In a running battle , Harley and Marlboro alternately flee and face off with steadily - declining elements of the squad until a final showdown in the penthouse suite of the Great Trust bank . The closing scene : Marlboro has gone back to rodeo bull - riding and Harley on his bike takes to the road , stopping only temporarily to pick up a ravishing and shapely hitchhiker who tells him she is going `` no place special '' , a destination that Harley promises to take her . Much of the film was filmed in and around Tucson , Arizona and the `` Boneyard '' at Davis - Monthan Air Force Base .",

It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada . From 1942 to 1946 , the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that designed the actual bombs . The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District ; `` Manhattan '' gradually superseded the official codename , Development of Substitute Materials , for the entire project . Along the way , the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart , Tube Alloys . The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939 , but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US $2 billion ( about $22 billion in 2016 dollars ) . Over 90 % of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material , with less than 10 % for development and production of the weapons . Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada .",

Now sober , she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe , and regain the trust of her daughter Violet , who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode . In addition , she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie , who never learned to play her role well and who would rather go out and drink than baby - sit . Christy later finds out that her biological father ran out on Bonnie on Christmas Eve , the day before Christy was born , and locates the man as a now - married father of two sons who runs an auto repair shop . </Li> <Li> Allison Janney as Bonnie Plunkett : Christy 's mother , a joyful if cynical recovering addict who is now grateful with life . She tries desperately to regain the love and trust of her daughter , whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child . In her teen time Bonnie started drinking at 15 years old . She was in the foster care system being ricocheted around from house to house when she kept running off with Alvin , she ended up plainly pregnant and had Christy however he abandoned them at the hospital and Bonnie nearly put Christy up for adoption . A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her , yet Bonnie pulled out finally . From that point on , she attempted her best to raise Christy , however Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie drank heavily and took tranquilizes and got back home late . A single mother , she preferred to party and drink rather than stay home . With time and much therapy , Bonnie managed to find the balance and now wants to catch up , revealing to Christy her past , including who her real father is and how to find him , as well as her past side career as a drug dealer . </Li> <Li> Sadie Calvano as Violet Plunkett ( main cast seasons 1 -- 3 ; recurring season 4 ) : Christy 's daughter and older half - sister of Roscoe . A senior in high school at the beginning of the series , Violet is hardworking , smart and sure of herself , though upset with her mother , who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time . After having her boyfriend Luke 's baby , Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family 's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than she , her mother , or her grandmother ever had . During season 2 , in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior , Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her . She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik , a psychology professor at her university , but he breaks the engagement after she relapses - she has since been behaving in a gold digger-esque manner with other men .

The six northeastern counties , known as Northern Ireland , remained within the United Kingdom . The Irish Civil War followed soon after the War of Independence . The history of Northern Ireland has since been dominated by sporadic sectarian conflict between ( mainly Catholic ) Irish nationalists and ( mainly Protestant ) unionists . This conflict erupted into the Troubles in the late 1960s , until peace was achieved with the Belfast Agreement thirty years later .",

This unique distinction makes Logan the only person to have three Eurovision victories to his / her credit , as either singer , songwriter or both . The other four songwriters with more than one winning entry to their credit are , Willy van Hemert ( Netherlands , 1957 and 1959 ) , Yves Dessca ( Monaco , 1971 and Luxembourg , 1972 ) , Rolf L\u00f8vland ( Norway , 1985 and 1995 ) and Brendan Graham ( Ireland , 1994 and 1996 ) .",

The six northeastern counties , known as Northern Ireland , remained within the United Kingdom . The Irish Civil War followed soon after the War of Independence . The history of Northern Ireland has since been dominated by sporadic sectarian conflict between ( mainly Catholic ) Irish nationalists and ( mainly Protestant ) unionists .

        "context": "Full - scale war broke out between the Vi\u1ec7t Minh and France in late 1946 and the First Indochina War officially began . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France decided to bring former emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i back to power , as a political alternative to Ho Chi Minh . A Provisional Central Government was formed in 1948 , reuniting Annam and Tonkin , but the complete reunification of Vietnam was delayed for a year because of the problems posed by Cochinchina 's legal status . In July 1949 , the State of Vietnam was officially proclaimed , as a semi-independent country within the French Union , with B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i as Head of State . France was finally persuaded to relinquish its colonies in Indochina in 1954 when Viet Minh forces defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu . The 1954 Geneva Conference left Vietnam a divided nation , with H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh 's communist DRV government ruling the North from Hanoi and Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m 's Republic of Vietnam , supported by the United States , ruling the South from Saigon . Between 1953 and 1956 , the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms , including `` rent reduction '' and `` land reform '' , which resulted in significant political oppression . During the land reform , testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents , which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions . Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the Red River Delta area , a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time . However , declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time , although likely greater than 13,500 . In the South , Diem went about crushing political and religious opposition , imprisoning or killing tens of thousands .",

With the abolition of slavery in October 1886 , freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class . The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes ; therefore , many wealthy Cubans lost their property , and joined the urban middle class . The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased : only companies , and the most powerful plantation owners , remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879 , and many more across the island . After his second deportation to Spain in 1878 , Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed moved to the United States in 1881 . There he mobilized the support of the Cuban exile community , especially in Ybor City ( Tampa area ) and Key West , Florida . His goal was revolution in order to achieve independence from Spain . Mart\u00ed lobbied against the U.S. annexation of Cuba , which was desired by some politicians in both the U.S. and Cuba .",

In this adaptation , her identity is Isabel Maru , a Spanish chemist recruited by General Erich Ludendorff to create chemical weapons for the German army . Due to facial disfigurement , she wears a ceramic mask over the left side of her face . It marks the character 's first live action appearance , although the setting is World War I rather than the World War II setting of the comic books . When Steve Trevor steals a book of Doctor Maru 's notes on her new chemical weapons that would render the gas masks useless against them , he crash - lands on Themyscira during his escape , which alerts Diana to the current war . She initially believes that Ares is directly responsible for the war , but later learns that all he did was provide a few ideas for the weapons to the likes of Maru while the decision to use the weapons was still the choice of the humans themselves . Ares attempts to sway Diana to his point of view by offering her a chance to kill Maru for her sins and part in the war , but Diana rejects his offer upon realizing of Trevor 's sacrifice that inspires her to recognize that she must accept humanity for its flaws rather than condemn it for not being perfect . This leads Diana to spare Maru out of mercy , who then flees . </Li> </Ul>",

        "context": "It was suggested that the interior of the 45 metre ( 147 ft ) wide dome should be covered with a mosaic decoration to make the most of the available light coming through the circular windows of the drum and through the lantern . Brunelleschi had proposed the vault to glimmer with resplendent gold , but his death in 1446 put an end to this project , and the walls of the dome were whitewashed . Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici decided to have the dome painted with a representation of The Last Judgment . This enormous work , 3,600 metres2 ( 38 750 ft2 ) of painted surface , was started in 1568 by Giorgio Vasari and Federico Zuccari and would last till 1579 . The upper portion , near the lantern , representing The 24 Elders of Apoc. 4 was finished by Vasari before his death in 1574 . Federico Zuccari and a number of collaborators , such as Domenico Cresti , finished the other portions : ( from top to bottom ) Choirs of Angels ; Christ , Mary and Saints ; Virtues , Gifts of the Holy Spirit and Beatitudes ; and at the bottom of the cupola : Capital Sins and Hell . These frescoes are considered Zuccari 's greatest work . But the quality of the work is uneven because of the input of different artists and the different techniques . Vasari had used true fresco , while Zuccari had painted in secco . During the restoration work , which ended in 1995 , the entire pictorial cycle of The Last Judgment was photographed with specially designed equipment and all the information collected in a catalogue . All the restoration information along with reconstructed images of the frescos were stored and managed in the Thesaurus Florentinus computer system .",

Afterwards , the family joins the other residents at the Mayor 's office , as Mary Margaret ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) , who is still trying to balance both maternal and mayoral duties , is holding the first annual `` Mayor 's Fireside Chat , '' where she assures the citizens that they are no longer afraid of Regina 's influence , but it appears that they want Mary Margaret to do something about the town 's snowy fiasco . Mary Margaret then tells the residents about Elsa 's presence in Storybrooke and is trying to reassure everyone that she is not dangerous , only to have Marian beginning to start feeling as if something was glossing over her and she passes out .

        "context": "In 1987 the United Nation 's World Commission on Environment and Development ( the Brundtland Commission ) , in its report Our Common Future suggested that development was acceptable , but it must be sustainable development that would meet the needs of the poor while not increasing environmental problems . Humanity 's demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption . In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand ; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations . A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling , and renewable energies emerged . The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and ' 80s , primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity , presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation , the first large - scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and ' 90s . Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small - scale sustainability policies .",

In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters ; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war . Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican -- American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram , which was intercepted by British Intelligence . Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic . Wilson then asked Congress for `` a war to end all wars '' that would `` make the world safe for democracy '' , and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6 , 1917 . On December 7 , 1917 , the U.S. declared war on Austria - Hungary . U.S. troops began arriving on the Western Front in large numbers in 1918 .",

        "context": "External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars .",

This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band 's initial apathy towards the composition , which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator , Eric Clapton , to contribute to the recording .

It was written by George Harrison , the band 's lead guitarist . The song serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles following their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968 . This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band 's initial apathy towards the composition , which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator , Eric Clapton , to contribute to the recording . Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part , although he was not formally credited for his contribution .",

        "question": "what emperor took over france after the reign of terror?",
        "context": "External threats closely shaped the course of the Revolution . The Revolutionary Wars beginning in 1792 ultimately featured French victories that facilitated the conquest of the Italian Peninsula , the Low Countries and most territories west of the Rhine -- achievements that had eluded previous French governments for centuries . Internally , popular agitation radicalised the Revolution significantly , culminating in the rise of Maximilien Robespierre and the Jacobins . The dictatorship imposed by the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror , from 1793 until 1794 , established price controls on food and other items , abolished slavery in French colonies abroad , dechristianised society through the creation of a new calendar and the expulsion of religious figures , and secured the borders of the new republic from its enemies . Large numbers of civilians were executed by revolutionary tribunals during the Terror , with estimates ranging from 16,000 to 40,000 . After the Thermidorian Reaction , an executive council known as the Directory assumed control of the French state in 1795 . The rule of the Directory was characterised by suspended elections , debt repudiations , financial instability , persecutions against the Catholic clergy , and significant military conquests abroad . Dogged by charges of corruption , the Directory collapsed in a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 . Napoleon , who became the hero of the Revolution through his popular military campaigns , went on to establish the Consulate and later the First Empire , setting the stage for a wider array of global conflicts in the Napoleonic Wars .",

The semiconservative model seemed most reasonable since it would allow each daughter strand to remain associated with its template strand .

        "question": "who proved that cells come from other cells?",
        "context": "In biology , cell theory is the historic scientific theory , now universally accepted , that living organisms are made up of cells . Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction . With continual improvements made to microscopes over time , magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century . This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke , and began the scientific study of cells , also known as cell biology . Over a century later , many debates about cells began amongst scientists . Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration , and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life . Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839 . This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann . However , many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory .",

This feeling of miscalculation and failure is admitted by Kennedy in the U.S. ambassador 's residence with New York Times columnist James `` Scotty '' Reston . Kennedy made the regrettable error of admitting that the US would not actively oppose this action in the Soviet sector of Berlin . On Saturday , 12 August 1961 , the leaders of the GDR attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in D\u00f6llnsee , in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin . There Ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a wall .",

However , other sources suggest that Khrushchev had initially been wary about building a wall , fearing negative Western reaction .

        "context": "The printing press was invented in the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 , based on existing screw presses . Gutenberg , a goldsmith by profession , developed a printing system , by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes , as well as making inventions of his own . His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities . Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe . In East Asia , where it was invented , the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and , without the hand mould , the production of sorts ( individual letters of type ) was slow . In Europe , the two inventions , the hand mould and the printing press , together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents , particularly in short print runs .",

The culmination of a lengthy political battle between Johnson , a lifelong Democrat and the Republican majority in Congress over how best to deal with the defeated Southern states following the conclusion of the American Civil War , the impeachment , and the subsequent trial ( and acquittal ) of Johnson were among the most dramatic events in the political life of the nation during the Reconstruction Era . Together , they have gained a historical reputation as an act of political expedience , rather than necessity , which was based on Johnson 's defiance of an unconstitutional piece of legislation , and which was conducted with little regard for the will of a general public which , despite the unpopularity of Johnson , opposed the impeachment .",

The House 's primary charge against Johnson was violation of the Tenure of Office Act , passed by the U.S. Congress in March 1867 , over the president 's veto . Specifically , he had removed from office Edwin M. Stanton , the Secretary of War -- whom the Act was largely designed to protect -- and attempted to replace him with Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas ( Earlier , while Congress was not in session , Johnson had suspended Stanton and appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as secretary of war ad interim ) .",

She assists the Ravagers with a mutiny against Yondu which results in her freedom and Yondu , Rocket , and Groot 's capture . Nebula convinces the Ravagers to spare the three due to the many bounties on their heads , of which Nebula wants a 10 % cut . She leaves using one of their ships to track down and kill Gamora on Ego , as the torture she received from Thanos and her cybernetic body parts were a result of Gamora constantly defeating her when they were children .

Her desire to kill Gamora abated , the pair reach an uneasy alliance , after which they discover caverns filled with the skeletal remains of Ego 's many children .

        "context": "Initially , host nation Russia matched the Soviet Union 's 1976 achievement of thirteen gold medals , but 4 gold medals ( 13 overall ) were stripped later due to doping . Norway achieved the leading position in the medal table on 24 November 2017 , when Russia was stripped of two gold medals in bobsleigh . However , at the end of January 2018 , the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared 28 Russian athletes and 9 out of 13 medals ( including 3 gold ) were reinstated , allowing Russia to return to the top position .",

        "context": "Ai n't Living Long Like This is the debut studio album by American country music singer - songwriter Rodney Crowell , released in 1978 by Warner Bros. Records . It failed to enter the Top Country Albums chart . The songs , `` Elvira '' , `` Baby Better Start Turnin ' ' Em Down '' and `` ( Now and Then , There 's ) A Fool Such as I '' were released as singles but they all failed to chart within the top 40 . Despite this , Ai n't Living Long Like This is considered one Crowell 's best and most influential albums . Brett Hartenbach of Allmusic says it `` not only showcases his songwriting prowess , but also his ability to deliver a song , whether it 's one of his own or the work of another writer '' . Most of the songs on this album were later covered by other artists including The Oak Ridge Boys and Alan Jackson . When the album was re-released in 2002 the font on the cover was enlarged to make it more legible .",

        "question": "where did the british army launch a successful invasion in 1776?",
        "context": "After withdrawing from Boston , Howe immediately began preparations to seize New York which was considered the ' hinge ' of the colonies . In late August , 22,000 men ( including 9,000 Hessians ) were rapidly landed on Long Island using flat bottomed boats , this would be the largest amphibious operation undertaken by the British army until the Normandy landings almost 200 years later . In the ensuing Battle of Long Island on August 27 , 1776 , the British outflanked the American positions , driving the Americans back to the Brooklyn Heights fortifications . General Howe not wishing to risk the lives of his men in a bloody frontal assault then began to lay siege works . The navy had failed to properly blockade the East river which left an escape route open for Washington 's army , which he fully exploited , managing a nighttime retreat through his unguarded rear to Manhattan Island . British forces then fought a series of actions to consolidate control of Manhattan Island , culminating in the Battle of Fort Washington which resulted in the capture of close to 3,000 Continental troops . Following the conquest of Manhattan , Howe ordered Charles Cornwallis to `` clear the rebel troops from New Jersey without a major engagement , and to do it quickly before the weather changed . '' Cornwallis ' force drove Washington 's army entirely from New Jersey and across the Delaware River . However , in the pre-dawn hours of December 26 , Washington crossed back into New Jersey and captured a garrison of Hessians at Trenton . Several days later , Washington outmaneuvered Cornwallis at Assunpink Creek and overwhelmed a British outpost at Princeton on January 3 , 1777 . Cornwallis rallied and again drove Washington away , however the defeats showed the British army had become too overstretched and Howe abandoned most of his outposts in New Jersey .",

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems .",

While not physically powerful , Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him . In Season Three , Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin , a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for . Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark ; however , on the wedding night , Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone , promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to .

Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth , but stayed himself for the sake of duty . In season 4 , Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King 's Landing for Joffrey 's wedding to Margaery Tyrell , though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister , who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin 's orders .

Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae , who testified against him and is now Tywin 's lover . After a brief struggle , Tyrion strangles Shae to death , and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey 's crossbow . Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys . They arrive in Pentos , where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne .

However , in some major cities , the definition of a firearm within their respected ordinances includes propulsion by spring or compressed air , thus making airsoft subject to applicable laws . For example , airsoft guns within the state of California can only be bought by a person above the age of 18 . However , no laws indicate an age requirement to sell airsoft guns .

The offensive team must have at least seven players lined up on the line of scrimmage . Of the players on the line of scrimmage , only the two players on the ends of the line of scrimmage are eligible receivers . The remaining players are in the backfield ( four in American football , five in Canadian football ) , including the quarterback . These backfield players are also eligible receivers . In the National Football League , a quarterback who takes his stance behind center as a T - formation quarterback is not eligible unless , before the ball is snapped , he legally moves to a position at least one yard behind the line of scrimmage or on the end of the line , and is stationary in that position for at least one second before the snap , but is nonetheless not counted toward the seven men required on the line of scrimmage .",

Shiobana turns out to be a middle school student named Giorno Giovanna -- which sounds similar to `` Haruno Shiobana '' -- who is the son of Dio Brando . Giorno attempts to steal Koichi 's luggage , but is stopped by Koichi 's Stand , Echoes Act Three . Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience , a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects . The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people , specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned . After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface . Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione , and therefore visit the Capo , Polpo , in prison .",

        "context": "In Genesis 17 when Abram was ninety - nine years old , God declared his new name : `` Abraham '' -- `` a father of many nations '' , and gave him the covenant of circumcision . God gave Sarai the new name `` Sarah '' , and blessed her . Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son . Not long afterwards , Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men . One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year , Sarah would have a son . While at the tent entrance , Sarah overheard what was said , and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages . The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child , for her age was as nothing to God . Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham , at the very time which had been spoken . The patriarch , then a hundred years old , named the child `` Isaac '' ( Hebrew yitschaq , `` laughter '' ) and circumcised him when he was eight days old . For Sarah , the thought of giving birth and nursing a child , at such an old age , also brought her much laughter , as she declared , `` God had made me to laugh , ( so that ) all that hear will laugh with me . '' Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned . It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company . Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked .",

        "context": "In 1966 , the Dallas Cowboys , who had been founded six years earlier , adopted the practice of hosting Thanksgiving games . It is widely rumored that the Cowboys sought a guarantee that they would regularly host Thanksgiving games as a condition of their very first one ( since games on days other than Sunday were uncommon at the time and thus high attendance was not a certainty ) . This is only partly true ; Dallas had in fact decided to host games on Thanksgiving by their own decision because there was nothing else to do or watch on that day . In 1975 and 1977 , at the behest of then - Commissioner Pete Rozelle , the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team ( Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 ) . Although the Cardinals , at the time known as the `` Cardiac Cards '' due to their propensity for winning very close games , were a modest success at the time , they were nowhere near as popular nationwide as the Cowboys , who were regular Super Bowl contenders during this era . This , combined with St. Louis 's consistently weak attendance , a series of ugly Cardinals losses in the three - game stretch , and opposition from the Kirkwood -- Webster Groves Turkey Day Game ( a local high school football contest ) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978 ; it was then , after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games , that the Cowboys requested ( and received ) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day forever .",

Explanations for the demise of the Yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against Han Chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion , overtaxation of areas hard - hit by inflation , and massive flooding of the Yellow River as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects . Consequently , agriculture and the economy were in shambles , and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the Yellow River . A number of Han Chinese groups revolted , including the Red Turbans in 1351 . The Red Turbans were affiliated with the White Lotus , a Buddhist secret society . Zhu Yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and Buddhist monk who joined the Red Turbans in 1352 ; he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander .

When he was about forty years old , he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel , which would later form the Quran , enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith , warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day , and castigate social injustices of his city . Muhammad 's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca . In 618 , after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib ( subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers . Later generations would count this event , known as the hijra , as the start of the Islamic era .",

For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88.1 % tin and 11.9 % oxygen and the other is 78.7 % tin and 21.3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5 g or 27g of oxygen . 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units -- in other words , atoms . In the case of tin oxides , one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms .",

        "question": "who gave the famous objective co relative theory?",
        "context": "The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative .",

According to the Woese system , introduced in 1990 , the tree of life consists of three domains : Archaea , Bacteria , and Eukarya . The first two are all prokaryotic microorganisms , or single - celled organisms whose cells have no nucleus . All life that has a nucleus and membrane - bound organelles , and multicellular organisms , is included in the Eukarya .

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 , Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years .",

        "context": "In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships , the Ni\u00f1a , the Pinta , and the flagship , Santa Maria , seeking a direct route to Asia . On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain , an event long regarded by Europeans as the ' discovery ' of America . This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan , and San Salvador by the Spanish . The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial , but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison 's identification of Columbus ' San Salvador as what was later called Watling ( or Watling 's ) Island . Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador . Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present - day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola .",

        "context": "The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria . In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism . They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus .

        "context": "Since 1718 , transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain , with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic . Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783 , the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia . The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean , claimed the continent for Britain , and named it New South Wales . In 1778 , Joseph Banks , Cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840 . The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria , making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city ( after London ) in the British Empire .",

        "question": "who plays the dragon queen from game of thrones?",
        "context": "Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke . Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen",

        "context": "During World War I , in an effort to conserve fuel , Germany began observing DST on May 1 , 1916 . The rest of Europe soon followed . The plan was not adopted in the United States until the Standard Time Act of March 19 , 1918 , which confirmed the existing standard time zone system and set summer DST to begin on March 31 , 1918 ( reverting October 27 ) . The idea was unpopular and Congress abolished DST after the war , overriding President Woodrow Wilson 's veto . DST became a local option and was observed in some states until World War II , when President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year - round DST , called `` War Time '' , on February 9 , 1942 . It lasted until the last Sunday ( the 30th ) in September 1945 . After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River ( and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers ) adopted summer DST .",

Creators.com called the routine `` brilliantly imaginative . '' Pioneer Local called it `` powerful ... It 's been so long since ( Tabitha and Napoleon ) have had a showstopping hip - hop number on SYTYCD . Not since Season 4 when they had Katee , Joshua , tWitch , Mark and Chelsie have they pulled out hip - hop this good . '' The routine was performed by ballet dancer Alex Wong and `` All - Star '' hip - hop dancer Stephen `` tWitch '' Boss from season four . The concept is about a psychologist ( tWitch ) who teaches a dancer ( Alex ) to let go of his technique and inhibitions and just dance . After the performance , tWitch and Alex received a standing ovation from the crowd and all three judges -- Nigel Lythgoe , Mia Michaels , and Adam Shankman . Host Cat Deeley commented `` I have never , never , in ' So You Think You Can Dance ' history , heard a roar from a crowd like this - ever . '' Lythgoe called the concept `` brilliant ... This is about a ballet dancer doing the most incredible hip - hop ... If this routine and you are not up for an Emmy with Napoleon and Tabitha next year , I do n't know why not . It 's probably one of the funnest , best hip - hop routines we 've ever had on this show . '' In slight disagreement , the Wall Street Journal noted that `` Outta Your Mind '' may in fact be nominated for an Emmy , but it is unlikely to win because past winners have all been lyrical , very emotional routines .",

        "context": "In 1989 , the Hawke Labor Government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study . It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme ( HECS ) , which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University , Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins ( see Dawkins Revolution ) . Under the original HECS , a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students , and the Commonwealth paid the balance . A student could defer payment of this HECS amount ( in which case it was called a HECS debt ) and repay the debt through the tax system , when the student 's income exceeds a threshold level . As part of the reforms , Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means . The HECS system was accepted by both federal political parties and has survived until today , though with a number of changes .",

The first ship loaded with Hebridean colonists arrived on `` St. - John 's Island '' ( Prince Edward Island ) in 1770 , with later ships following in 1772 , and 1774 . In 1773 a ship named The Hector landed in Pictou , Nova Scotia , with 189 settlers , mostly originating from Lochbroom . In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement -- a law restricting land - ownership on Cape Breton Island -- was repealed , and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic - speaking . It is estimated more than 50,000 Gaelic settlers emigrated to Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island between 1815 and 1870 .",

        "context": "In 1762 the earliest of the Fuadaich nan G\u00e0idheal ( Scottish Highland Clearances ) forced many Gaelic families off their ancestral lands . The first ship loaded with Hebridean colonists arrived on `` St. - John 's Island '' ( Prince Edward Island ) in 1770 , with later ships following in 1772 , and 1774 . In 1773 a ship named The Hector landed in Pictou , Nova Scotia , with 189 settlers , mostly originating from Lochbroom . In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement -- a law restricting land - ownership on Cape Breton Island -- was repealed , and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic - speaking . It is estimated more than 50,000 Gaelic settlers emigrated to Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island between 1815 and 1870 .",

Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013 , announcing his departure in 2014 . He was to continue to present special editions of the show . For some of the second series , Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave ; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013 . The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli , Arlene Phillips , Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood . Alesha Dixon took Phillips ' place from series 7 to 9 , after which she left the programme to judge Britain 's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her ; Bussell remains a judge alongside Tonioli and Revel Horwood . Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously . Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten , giving an overall total out of forty . The voice - over announcer is Alan Dedicoat . During series four , an hour - long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19 : 00 on BBC Two , and during series five and six , the results show moved to Sunday evenings , although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast `` as live '' on the Sunday .",

Oscar Robertson , Michael Jordan , Shaquille O'Neal , and LeBron James have each won the award three times , while Bob Cousy , Julius Erving , Isiah Thomas , Magic Johnson , Karl Malone , Allen Iverson , and Russell Westbrook have all won the award twice . James ' first All - Star MVP in 2006 made him the youngest to have ever won the award at the age of 21 years , 1 month . Kyrie Irving , winner of the 2014 All - Star Game MVP , is the second - youngest at 21 years , 10 months . They are notable as being the two youngest to win the award , both as Cleveland Cavaliers . Four of the games had joint winners -- Elgin Baylor and Pettit in 1959 , John Stockton and Malone in 1993 , O'Neal and Tim Duncan in 2000 , and O'Neal and Bryant in 2009 . O'Neal became the first player in All - Star history to share two MVP awards as well as the first player to win the award with multiple teams . The Los Angeles Lakers have had eleven winners while the Boston Celtics have had eight . Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Irving of Australia are the only winners not born in the United States . Both Duncan and Irving are American citizens , but are considered `` international '' players by the NBA because they were not born in one of the fifty states or Washington , D.C. No player trained entirely outside the U.S. has won the award ; Irving lived in the U.S. since age two , and Duncan played U.S. college basketball at Wake Forest .",

        "context": "Around 10,200 BC the first fully developed Neolithic cultures belonging to the phases Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ( PPNA ) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ( 7600 to 6000 BC ) appeared in the fertile crescent and from there spread eastwards and westwards . One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period . In the south , the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC ; when it is replaced by the Uruk period .",

        "context": "The Tower of London , officially Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London , is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London . It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name , was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression , inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite . The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ) , although that was not its primary purpose . A grand palace early in its history , it served as a royal residence . As a whole , the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion , mainly under Kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries . The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site .",

Both the cap and the floor are adjusted annually based on the league 's revenues , and they have increased each year .

Using the formula provided in the league 's collective bargaining agreement , the floor in 2009 was $112.1 million . Under the NFL 's agreement with the NFLPA , the effects on the salary cap of guaranteed payments ( such as signing bonuses ) are , with a few rare exceptions , prorated evenly over the term of the contract .",

While other inventors had produced devices that could record sounds , Edison 's phonograph was the first to be able to reproduce the recorded sound . His phonograph originally recorded sound onto a tinfoil sheet wrapped around a rotating cylinder . A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages . Later improvements through the years included modifications to the turntable and its drive system , the stylus or needle , and the sound and equalization systems .",

Unfortunately , he ends up repeatedly restarting his experiment due to Eleanor ( and one time Jason ) always figuring out that `` The Good Place '' is `` The Bad Place , '' leading to his routine failure , as well as hiding the constant resets from Shawn in order to avoid `` retirement '' . As part of a truce he makes with Eleanor so his failing project will not be exposed and a chance to reform his behavior , Michael agrees to let the humans keep their memories and help them get into the true Good Place as well as to take Chidi 's ethics lessons . </Li>",

Afterward , the U.S. government also faced difficulties in preventing frontier violence and eventually adopted policies similar to those of the Royal Proclamation . The first in a series of Indian Intercourse Acts was passed in 1790 , prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands . In 1823 , the U.S. Supreme Court case Johnson v. M'Intosh established that only the U.S. government , and not private individuals , could purchase land from Native Americans .",

        "question": "where was because i could not stop for death published?",
        "context": "The poem was published posthumously in 1890 in Poems : Series 1 , a collection of Dickinson 's poems assembled and edited by her friends Mabel Loomis Todd and Thomas Wentworth Higginson . The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) . The imagery changes from its original nostalgic form of children playing and setting suns to Death 's real concern of taking the speaker to afterlife .",

Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre .",

Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre .",

        "question": "who abandoned traditional harmony and created the twelve-tone system for composition?",
        "context": "Serialism of the first type is most specifically defined as the structural principle according to which a recurring series of ordered elements ( normally a set -- or row -- of pitches or pitch classes ) are used in order or manipulated in particular ways to give a piece unity . Serialism is often broadly applied to all music written in what Arnold Schoenberg called `` The Method of Composing with Twelve Notes related only to one another '' ( Schoenberg 1975 , 218 ; Anon . n.d. ) , or dodecaphony , and methods that evolved from his methods . It is sometimes used more specifically to apply only to music where at least one element other than pitch is subjected to being treated as a row or series . In such usages post-Webernian serialism will be used to denote works that extend serial techniques to other elements of music . Other terms used to make the distinction are twelve - note serialism for the former , and integral serialism for the latter .",

        "context": "Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina . As a freshman , he was a member of the Tar Heels ' national championship team in 1982 . Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick . He quickly emerged as a league star , entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring . His leaping ability , demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests , earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness . He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball . In 1991 , he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls , and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993 , securing a `` three - peat '' . Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993 -- 94 NBA season and started a new career playing minor league baseball , he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 , as well as a then - record 72 regular - season wins in the 1995 -- 96 NBA season . Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999 , but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards .",

        "context": "In music , serialism is a method of composition using series of pitches , rhythms , dynamics , timbres or other musical elements . Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg 's twelve - tone technique , though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking . Twelve - tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale , forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition 's melody , harmony , structural progressions , and variations . Other types of serialism also work with sets , collections of objects , but not necessarily with fixed - order series , and extend the technique to other musical dimensions ( often called `` parameters '' ) , such as duration , dynamics , and timbre .",

        "question": "who said everyone will be famous for 15 minutes?",
        "context": "15 minutes of fame is short - lived media publicity or celebrity of an individual or phenomenon . The expression was inspired by Andy Warhol 's words `` In the future , everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes '' , which appeared in the program for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm , Sweden . Photographer Nat Finkelstein claims credit for the expression , stating that he was photographing Warhol in 1966 for a proposed book . A crowd gathered trying to get into the pictures and Warhol supposedly remarked that everyone wants to be famous , to which Finkelstein replied , `` Yeah , for about fifteen minutes , Andy . '' The phenomenon is often used in reference to figures in the entertainment industry or other areas of popular culture , such as reality television and YouTube .",

        "context": "Regretting it instantly , Eric goes to find her to once again reconcile , and learns that she and Michael have taken off for California where they spend the remainder of the summer . Despite his parents foreboding , Eric takes off after Donna and they reconcile instantly and continue their relationship . Later , Eric contemplates in front of his friends the idea of proposing to Donna , something they all instantly point out the idiocy . However , the two do get engaged as he proposes , somewhat awkwardly , atop the water tower . After taking the SAT 's he realizes he got the lowest score of the group , even getting a worse score than Kelso , prompting him to work harder in order to marry Donna . Eric also thinks hard about his future , choosing to move to Madison with Donna . In the fifth season , Eric and Donna become engaged , despite widespread discouragement ( and anger , in the case of Red ) . However , they refuse to call off the engagement and remain engaged until the end of the sixth season . Eventually , they both begin to experience pre-wedding jitters and Eric , acting upon these feelings , skips his wedding rehearsal . He then returns in the next episode and Donna forgives him .",
